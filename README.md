<h1 align="center">Hi üëã, I'm Michael C. Cruz</h1>
<h3 align="center">I am a Computer Science student at UPLB.</h3>

<h3 align="left">About me:</h3>
<p>Some people will not believe me when I say that I have a big space inside me that is reserved only for Computer Science. It all started simple, just like some of you. It was elementary days when computer shops became a trend in almost every streets in Taguig City, where I am from. It was the time of my first email account and then first FB account. Opening the computer I reserved for an hour, waiting for the loading display, trying to right-click then refresh + F5 in desktop again and again (maybe to test if the computer is ready for me), playing online games, searching online for Golden Sun: The Lost Age codes, printing school works, and others are the things that tested my patience and curiosity for computers. </p>

<p>We had our first desktop inside our home about the time when I started trying to wake up before 6 am to prepare for my classes as a junior high school student at Taguig Science High School. There were times when I spent more time and effort trying to learn programming using Blitz BASIC and the old Python which uses print without parentheses than doing my assignments. I realized those times and efforts paid well when our computer subject tackled Javascript and Visual Basic which I had a very enjoyable time learning. We did not have the best home desktop computer, my school is not the best for computer subjects, and I definitely was not the best student when it comes to computer. However, I can say is that I treasured every experiences even the not so enjoyable ones, including the errors, the blue screen, the slow and limited internet connection, and the late night programming ideas which prevented me from a having some quality night sleeps.</p>

<p>I can say that I am good and passionate at Math since I was one of the students that really pursued the opportunity to test my skills on an international competition and even got a silver medal on a national level one. Those opportunities and experiences are one of the big reasons why I pursued and finished BS Applied Mathematics program at UPLB. Currently, I am pursuing MS Computer Science here in UPLB. I hope that I will become one of those people who contributed or are currently contributing to Computer Science, in research and instruction, which in turn are giving inspiration and opening more opportunities to others. </p>
